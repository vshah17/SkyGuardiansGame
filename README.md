**Sky Guardians Game**

My gallery shooter game 2B assignment for CMPM120 spring 2024.

"Sky Guardians" is a gallery shooter where the player controls a futuristic airplane protecting Earth from an alien invasion. The game has a vibrant, pixel-art aesthetic, featuring whimsical and colorful alien spacecrafts as the invaders. The player's goal is to defend against waves of enemies with varying attack patterns, using bullets and special power-ups, while navigating a one-dimensional horizontal axis at the bottom of the screen. The narrative combines a classic battle theme with a light-hearted tone, suitable for all ages.
